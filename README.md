# Today Feels - Beginner App

Today Feels is a simple web application developed during the early stages of my journey in JavaScript development. While it may not be the most sophisticated app, it serves as a great starting point for those who are new to JavaScript and web development.

The App showcases people's feelings in a shuffled way, a twitter API is also provided in `client.js` if you would like to use it to generate the thoughts.
